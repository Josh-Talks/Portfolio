- A multidisciplinary competition requiring the intgration of Mechanical, Electrical and Software engineering to produce a mine clearing robot, to sweep an area for mines and safely identify, collect and transport the mines to a safe location within a time limitation. 
- Using C/C++ and Python to code an Arduino based robot that used computer vision combined with IR,
Ultrasound and hall effect sensors all mounted on a custom chassis to detect, map route and collect mines.
- Mechanical design using CAD and prototyping. 
- Electricl design using EAGLE electronic PCB design software.
