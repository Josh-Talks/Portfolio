I am an incoming Masters student in my final year studying engineering at the Univeristy of Cambridge. After two years studying general engineering covering all the major disciplines I chose modules to specialise in Bioengineering and Information/Computing Engineering.

I am particulary interested in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, especially in the field of computer vision and biological image analysis. There are vast amounts of data in modern health care and I am interested in using analytical and statistical methods to mine big data sets for trends that can lead to actionable insights. Machine learning algorithms are of great importance and I have completed a research project investigating their application to biological image analysis and also taken modules such as Probabilistic Machine Learning and Deep learning and Structural Data to learn more in this area. A few of the technologies I have worked with are listed below.

Outside of studying I love tennis, badminton, road biking and photography. I am captain of the university Men's 4th team for tennis and also play badminton at the university level. Its one of life's great pleasure to be out on court on a sunny day.
