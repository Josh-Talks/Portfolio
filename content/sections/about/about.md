I am an incoming Masters student in my final year studying engineering at the Univeristy of Cambridge. After two years studying general engineering covering all the major disciplines I chose modules to specialise in Bioengineering and Information and Computing Engineering.

I am particulary interested in Data Science and using analytical and statistical methods to mine big data sets for trends that can lead to actionable insights. Machine learning algorithms are of great importance and I have taken modules such as statistical signal processing and Inference to learn more in this area. Here are a few of the technologies I have worked with.

Outside of studying I love tennis, badminton, road biking and photography. I am college captain for the badminton and play tennis for both the university and college. Its one of life's great pleasure to be out on court on a sunny day.
